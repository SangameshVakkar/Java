Packages :
        * Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces.
        * Making searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier.
    Types of packages:
        1. Built-in packages     --> packages are already available - ready to use in java.
        2. User-define packages  --> packages that user creates for their convenient.


Access modifiers :
        * object-oriented programming that is used to set the accessibility of classes, constructors, methods, and other members of Java.
    Types of Access Modifiers :
        1. Private      : the access level of this modifier is within class, it cannot be accessed out side the class.
        2. Default      : this modifier can be accessed within the packages, if we do not specify the class as "default", it considered as default class.
        3. Protected    : this modifier access level is both within and outside the packages through child class. Without the child class it is not accessible.
        4. Public       : this modifier acces level is everywhere. It can be accessed within and outside classes and packages.
