Static : -
        * Perform type checkinig at compile time.
        * Erroes will show ar compile time.
        * Declare datatype before you use it.
        * More control.
            Ex:  int a = 10;
            * In above given example, the compiler checks the given variable data type in satatic language.


Dynamic : -
        * Perform type checking at runtime.
        * Error might not show till program runs.
        * No need to declare datatype of variables.
        * Saves time in writing but might give error at runtime.
            Ex:  a = 10
            * In above given example, the dynamic language checks the datatype is runtime.
